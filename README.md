# IV-9Clock

The goal of this project is to make a clock with IV-9 numitrons. 

## Choices
The preliminary choice of microcontroller is the ATMEL ATmega328P. Because an Arduino Nano can be used for development. We are likely to use a TFQP package to save space on our board. For resistors and other components, we'll use SMD components.

# Milestones:

- Preliminary board schematic
- Development component list
- Program development
- Custom board schematic
- Assembly and finish
